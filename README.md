This is my solution to the [second round](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/42/2/) of the 42nd [Bundeswettbewerb Informatik](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/).

The details of my solution for part 1 are found [here](aufgabe1/) and for part 3 are found [here](aufgabe3/).

As this competition is held in German, the program and its documentation are also written in German. Perhaps google translate might help you out here...
